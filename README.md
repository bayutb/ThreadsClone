# Thread App Clone (UI Only)

I created this project 2 days after Thread App officially launch because i just realized that they are using Jetpack Compose to build the app. So i know i can do that

### Requirements : 
- Android Studio (Giraffe | 2022.3.1)
- Emulator / Physical Device (Android SDK Version : 27 or later)

## Installation

Launch Android Studio, then click Get from VCS. Then input this url:
``https://github.com/bayutb/YNNotes.git``

Then wait until the build process finished.

## Usage
Click run app or press `Shift + F10`. 
Make sure your Android Studio have an Android Emulator installed or connected with Physical Android Device

This can take up to 5 minutes until the app will automatically launch on your emulator or physical device
